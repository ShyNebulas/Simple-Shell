# CS210-Group-3-Shell

# Usage
If Make is installed on your machine then you will be able to navigate to the ``build`` folder and run ``make`` to compile the program. Otherwise you can compile the program using GCC:

```gcc -o ../dep/headers/functionDefinitions.c ../src/helpers/helperFunctions.c ../src/modules/cd.c ../src/modules/execute.c ../src/modules/userInput.c ..src/modules/history.c  ../src/main.c -o main ```

# Notes
In the Gitlabs commits you may see ``ShyNebulas`` this is actually Cameron Bell but he forgot to change his global git username and email.
